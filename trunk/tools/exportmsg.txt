Checklist for release process: 

  - If you haven't already, you need to begin by...

    - Moving everything interesting from src/RECENTNEWS to doc/changes.tex  

    - Doing 'svn update' to find out the current revision number

    - Incrementing the major version number by editing src/mkProjectInfo.ml
      (make sure that the new version is going to be X.Y.0 for some X and Y)

    - Doing a 'make checkin'

If any of this needs to be done, hit Ctrl-C and do it, then do 'make
release' again.  Otherwise, hit return.
