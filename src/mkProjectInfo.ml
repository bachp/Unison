(* Documentation:
   This is a program to construct a version of the form Major.Minor.Point,
   e.g., 2.10.4.
   The Point release number is calculated from the Subversion revision number,
   so it will be automatically incremented on svn commit.
   The Major and Minor numbers are hard coded, as is the revision number
   corresponding to the 0 point release.

   If you want to increment the Major or Minor number, you will have to do a
   little thinking to get the Point number back to 0.  Suppose the current svn
   revision number is 27, and we have below

        let majorVersion = 2
        let minorVersion = 11
        let pointVersionOrigin = 3

   This means that the current Unison version is 2.11.24, since 27-3 = 24.
   If we want to change the release to 3.0.0 we need to change things to

        let majorVersion = 3
        let minorVersion = 0
        let pointVersionOrigin = 28

   and then do a svn commit.

   The first two lines are obvious.  The last line says that Subversion
   revision 28 corresponds to a 0 point release.  Since we were at revision
   27 and we're going to do a commit before making a release, we
   will be at 28 after the commit and this will be Unison version 3.0.0.

(* BCP (1/10): This bit was added to help with getting Unison via bazaar, but it
   was never used much and I'm not confident it's working.  I'll comment it out
   for now, but if it hasn't been needed or fixed in a few months, the next
   person that edits this file should delete it...

          - The mentioned revision number might not be part of this branch
          - The mentioned revision number might be rhs of some merge

          On the whole, getting this to work seems too much effort for now.
          So we'll simply use the revno as is as the point version,
          and revisit offsetting them if unison should ever move its trunk to bzr.
