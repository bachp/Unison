.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page briefly documents Unison, and was written for the
Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not
have a manual page. For a full description, please refer to the
inbuilt documentation or the manuals in /usr/share/doc/@UNISON_PACKAGE@/. The
@UNISON_GTK@ binary has similar command-line options, but allows the user
to select and create profiles and configure options from within the
program.
.PP
Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows
two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on
different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified
separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in
each replica to the other.
.PP
Unison offers several advantages over various synchronization methods
such as CVS, Coda, rsync, Intellisync, etc. Unison can run on and
synchronize between Windows and many UNIX platforms. Unison requires
no root privileges, system access or kernel changes to function. Unison
can synchronize changes to files and directories in both directions,
on the same machine, or across a network using ssh or a direct
socket connection.
.PP
Transfers are optimised using a version of the rsync protocol, making
it ideal for slower links. Unison has a clear and precise specification,
and is resilient to failure due to its careful handling of the replicas
and its private structures.
.PP
The two roots can be specified using an URI or a path. The URI must follow the
convention: protocol://[user@][host][:port][/path]. The protocol part can be
file, socket, ssh or rsh.
.SH OPTIONS
All Unison options are long, starting with one dash (`-') only.
A summary of options is included here. For a complete description,
see the inbuilt documentation or the manuals in /usr/share/doc/@UNISON_PACKAGE@/.
