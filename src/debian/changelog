    * (Closes: #308683)

unison (2.13.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #322042)
  * Use the same binary version scheme as the "-addversionno" unison
    option (Closes: #308507)
  * Change the menu section to Apps/Tools (Closes: #308683). 
  * The conflict between unison and unison-gtk as proposed in bug #308683 will
    not be used: 
    * the dependency is mainly a documentation dependency (symlink for
      unison-gtk.1.gz and /usr/share/doc/unison-gtk )
    * user can choose to install both unison and unison-gtk
  * Correct a problem in the alternative system: when a package is upgraded
    upstream, the binary provided is also changed (ie going from 
    /usr/bin/unison-2.12.0 to /usr/bin/unison-2.13.16). So we symlinked the
    binary to unison-latest-stable and use this binary in the alternative
    system. 
  * Add a unison[-gtk].preinst in order to correct the former behavior of
    update alternatives.
  * Transition to svn-buildpackage

unison (2.10.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backport of sarge changes. Unison doesn't read/write on
    $HOME/.unison, it is only a hack used in Fspath.canonizeFspath
    and called from Os.unisonDir. Set the HOME variable before
    generating to be $(CURDIR) in debian/rules (Closes in sarge:#308773)

 -- Sylvain Le Gall <sylvain.le-gall@polytechnique.org>  Fri, 13 May 2005 00:11:09 +0200

unison (2.10.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Using PACKAGE_VERSION to substitute variable in doc-base. (Closes: #307411)
  * unison-gtk now recommends ssh-askpass, put a note in README.Debian
    concerning the fact that ssh-askpass is required for using a password
    protected SSH connection (Closes: #238854)
  * State the changes of archive format from 2.9.1 to 2.10.2 in NEWS.Debian
    (Closes: #308126)

 -- Sylvain Le Gall <sylvain.le-gall@polytechnique.org>  Mon,  9 May 2005 00:47:47 +0200

unison (2.10.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Transition to ocaml 3.08.3 ( Closes: #304124 )
  * Split the package unison in unison2.9.1 and unison for being able to
    have 2 versions of the protocol.
  * Use update-alternative to be able to install both unison2.9.1 and
    unison
  * Revisit the build system : use sed and mv to create package unison2.9.1
    and unison ( rename debhelper files in rule, subsitute @VERSION@ by the
    right version in the content of some files ).
  * Conflicts with package unison (<< 2.9.1-2 ), because this package install
    a binary "unison" which will conflict with update-alternative
  * Use a "Provide: unison" to manage the oldest package ( which provides
    also unison, but with a slightly different protocol ).
  * Remove the patch 01_ocaml_3_08 since it is applied upstream
  * Use a GTK2 interface, since GTK1 interface doesn't even build 
    (Closes: #252617)
  * No more HTML/PS documentation, only text documentation, because it is the
    only one i can produce without doing severe licence violation ( the former
    HTML version comes from a strange unison-manual.tex, which cannot be
    found, so i don't have the source and i cannot distribute files without
    source ) ( Closes: #171063, #184465 )
  * New upstream release ( Closes: #271415 )
  * Add NEWS.Debian to explain the split of the package
  * Correct and add a section to README.Debian.

unison (2.9.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Version to fix maintainer fields

 -- Sylvain Le Gall <sylvain.le-gall@polytechnique.org>  Mon,  7 Jun 2004 22:58:50 +0200

unison (2.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.				(closes: #142748)
  * Medium urgency to make woody release. Rationale:
     - upstream versions of unison are rarely, if ever, broken, and if 
       they are, are fixed within days. this release has had a week or
       two to sweat it out.
     - the previous version had problems on windows. seeing as
       cross-platform compatibility is a major feature of unison, this 
       could cause long-term aggrivation for people hoping to sync their
       woody box with their windows box.
     - unison's protocol is version specific, and if I waited until sid 
       released to upload this new version, I'd have to provide an old
       version in sid sooner than I'd have liked.
     - it'd really annoy me if the version in woody wasn't the latest 
       when it released. =)

 -- Robert McQueen <robot101@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Sep 2001 19:27:27 +0100

unison (2.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added libgtk1.2-dev build dep, but this is really a bug in lablgtk.
  * Optimised debian/rules to only call shell once to set a variable, and
     use that instead of an elaborate (and fallible) if construct.
