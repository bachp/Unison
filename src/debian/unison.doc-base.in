Title: Unison @VERSION@ Installation and Usage Manual
Author: Benjamin Pierce <bcpierce@cis.upenn.edu>
Abstract: Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and
 Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and
 directories to be stored on different hosts (or different
 disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought
 up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the
 other. This manual describes how to install and use Unison.
