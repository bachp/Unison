(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* This is the main program -- the thing that gets executed first when
   unison is run.

   The Main module is actually a functor that takes the user interface
   (e.g., Uitext or Uigtk) as a parameter.  This allows us to build with
   just one user interface at a time, which avoids having to always link
   in all the libraries needed by all the user interfaces.

   A non-functor interface is provided to allow the Mac GUI to reuse the
   startup code for non-GUI options.
 *)

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Some command-line arguments are handled specially during startup, e.g.,
   -doc
   -help
   -version
   -server
   -socket
   -ui
   They are expected to appear on the command-line only, not in a
   profile. In particular, -version and -doc will print to the
   standard output, so they only make sense if invoked from the
   command-line (and not a click-launched gui that has no standard
   output).

   Furthermore, the actions associated with these command-line
   arguments are executed without loading a profile or doing the usual
   command-line parsing. This is because we want to run the actions
   without loading a profile; and then we can't do command-line
   parsing because it is intertwined with profile loading.

   NB: the Mac GUI handles these options itself and needs to change 
   if any more are added.
